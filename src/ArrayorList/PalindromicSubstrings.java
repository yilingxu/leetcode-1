//Palindromic Substrings
//Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.
//The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings
//even they consist of same characters.
//Example 1:
//Input: "abc"
//Output: 3
//Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
//Example 2:
//Input: "aaa"
//Output: 6
//Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
