//String Compression
//Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.
//The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
//Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.
//After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.
//Input:
//["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
//Output:
//Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
